# Gene expression matrices

Gene expression is quantified in transcipts per million (TPM) by kallisto, and is presented as a two-dimensional matrix of **gene** against RNA-seq **samples** for each species.


## Data source

Data is obtained from previous studies. Species and data list curated by Marek Mutwil and Erielle Villanueva. More details on the download and processing pipeline used can be found in the data sources listed below.

- [LSTrAP-Kingdom](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/37/18/3053/6168119)
- [EVOREPRO](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-021-00958-2)
- Manually processed by Marek Mutwil (*Sesanum indicum, Lactuca sativa, Triticum dicoccoides*), using LSTrAP-Cloud

A record CDS source and the source project from which matrices are derived from are documented in this Google sheet: ==\# TODO: embed gooogle sheet==


## Data processing

Quality control on the samples of the expression matrices have already been performed by the each source projects. Gene identifiers used in the expression matrices are used as the point of reference throughout this project.


## Data availability

The processed PEP files are available [here]().
