# Gene expression matrices

## Data source

Gene expression is quantified in transcipts per million (TPM) by kallisto, and is presented as a two-dimensional matrix of gene against RNA-seq samples for each species.

Data is obtained from previous studies.  More details on the pipeline used can be found in the data sources listed below.

- [LSTrAP-Kingdom]()
- [EVOREPRO]()
- Other projects ==\# TODO: to update==

A record CDS source and the source project from which matrices are derived from are documented in this Google sheet: ==\# TODO: embed gooogle sheet==


## Data processing

Quality control on the samples of the expression matrices have already been performed by the each source projects. Gene identifiers used in the expression matrices are used as the point of reference throughout this project.


## Data availability

The processed PEP files are available [here]().
