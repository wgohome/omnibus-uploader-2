# Files to prepare

The sources of data files are described in the [data section](/data-processing).

The default file parsers are designed in a way that expects certain files in a certain format, though you are free to extend the parsers to parse in whatever way that is suitable in future. This page describes the format for input files that is expected by the default parsers.
